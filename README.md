<h2 style="color: #fee440;"> Lessons Learned </h2>

Object-based programming is very valuable in coding and most importantly in the business sector. Even if Java had a hard syntax, it was the most enjoyable software language I have ever used and tried.

I used Ellipse as compiler setup and file management was very difficult, and the installation of java's jdk file for interface was also very popular with me.

I started to apply the clena code principles to my codes where I wrote with topics such as encapsulation, polymorphism, spaghetti code, if abuse.
